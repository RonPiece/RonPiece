### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ron Blanki

I'm a software enthusiast focused on finding my first job in the industry. I'm actively improving my skills by practicing **LeetCode** and building my own projects.

I'm currently working on a personal **Python** project to **transfer files between iPhones over a local Wi-Fi network**. I'm also learning **Kotlin** and **Android development**.

I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects in **C, C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript**.
